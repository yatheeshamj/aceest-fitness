## Notes about Docker on Windows
This project includes a Dockerfile and GitHub Actions workflow. 
On older Windows versions where Docker Desktop/WSL2 is not supported, 
you can run the app and tests locally using Python (see instructions above). 

Docker build and tests are fully validated automatically in GitHub Actions CI/CD.
